<b>Meal Problem CS50P with a challenge <b></br>
</br>

The Problem: (In meal.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).)

This Python program determines the meal time based on the input time provided by the user.
How to Use?

    1.Run the program by executing the meal.py file.
    2.When prompted, enter a time in the format "HH:MM a.m./p.m." (e.g., "07:30 a.m.").
    3.The program will output whether it's breakfast time (between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m.), lunch       time (between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m.), dinner time (between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.), or         no meal time.

How it Works?

The program uses the input() function to get a string from the user, representing the time in the format "HH:MM a.m./p.m.". It then calls the convert() function to convert this string into a floating-point number, representing the time in decimal hours. The convert() function does this by first splitting the string into the hours and minutes parts, and then checking whether the minutes end with "a.m." or "p.m.". If the minutes end with "p.m.", the function adds 12 to the hours to convert to 24-hour time. It then converts the minutes to a decimal fraction of an hour by dividing by 60. If the minutes end with "a.m.", the function simply converts the minutes to a decimal fraction of an hour. If the minutes don't end with "a.m." or "p.m.", the function assumes that they represent a decimal fraction of an hour directly. The function returns the sum of the hours and the decimal minutes.

The program then checks whether the converted time falls within the breakfast, lunch, or dinner time windows using a series of if/elif statements. If the time falls within one of these windows, the program prints the corresponding message. Otherwise, it prints "no meal time".
